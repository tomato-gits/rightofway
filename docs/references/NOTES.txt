National Park Service Grand Canyon trail courtesy guidelines
Yield to mules and uphill hikers
When you encounter mules, follow the directions of the mule wrangler.
Otherwise, step to the side of the trail that is away from the edge and remain quiet and still.
If you're descending, slow down and yield to uphill travelers.
Some uphill travelers may see you and decide to stop or step off the trail â€” it's their call.
